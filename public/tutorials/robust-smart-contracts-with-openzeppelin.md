# Building robust smart contracts with OpenZeppelin

Smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum mainnet can deal with real money, so having our Solidity code free from errors and highly secure is essential.

[Zeppelin Solutions](https://zeppelin.solutions/), a smart contract auditing service, has recognized this need. Using their experience, they've put together a set of vetted smart contracts called [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/).

We can use and extend these contracts to create more secure dapps in less time. OpenZeppelin comes with a wide array of smart contracts for various important functions ([see them all here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity)), but today we'll be focusing on their token contracts. Specifically, we'll be extending their `StandardToken.sol` contract to create our own [ERC20](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard)-compliant token.


## Requirements

This tutorial expects you to have some knowledge of Truffle, Ethereum, and Solidity. If you haven't gone through our [Ethereum overview](/tutorials/ethereum-overview) and our [Pet Shop tutorial](/tutorials/pet-shop) yet, those would be great places to start.

For even more information, please see the following links:

* [Truffle documentation](/docs)
* [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)
* [Solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/)

We will primarily be using the command line for this tutorial, so please ensure you have basic familiarity with your operating system's terminal.

## Overview

In this tutorial we will be covering:

* Unboxing the front-end application
* Creating the "TutorialToken" smart contract
* Compiling and deploying the smart contract
* Interacting with the new token

## Unboxing the front-end application

In this tutorial, we are focusing on smart contract creation. To that end, we've created the front-end for you in the form of a Truffle Box.

1. On a terminal, create a project directory and navigate to it:

   ```shell
   mkdir oz-workspace
   cd oz-workspace
   ```

1. Unbox the `tutorialtoken` Truffle Box. This will give us our project template.

   ```shell
   truffle unbox tutorialtoken
   ```

1. Next, we'll install OpenZeppelin. The most recent version of OpenZeppelin can be found as an npm package.

   ```shell
   npm install zeppelin-solidity
   ```

## Creating the "TutorialToken" smart contract

With our front-end taken care of, we can focus on the `TutorialToken` contract.

1. In the `contracts/` directory of your Truffle Box, create the file `TutorialToken.sol` and add the following contents:

   ```javascript
   pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

   import 'zeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC20/StandardToken.sol';

   contract TutorialToken is StandardToken {

   }
   ```

   Things to notice:

   * Beyond the standard smart contract setup, we import the `StandardToken.sol` contract and declare our `TutorialToken`.
   * We use `is` to inherit from the `StandardToken` contract. Our contract will inherit all variables and functions from the `StandardToken` contract. Inherited functions and variables can be overwritten by redeclaring them in the new contract.

1. To set our own parameters for the token, we'll be declaring our own name, symbol, and other details. Add the following content block to the contract (between the curly braces):

   ```javascript
   string public name = 'TutorialToken';
   string public symbol = 'TT';
   uint8 public decimals = 2;
   uint public INITIAL_SUPPLY = 12000;
   ```

   Things to notice:

   * The `name` and `symbol` variables give our token a unique identity.
   * The `decimals` variable determines the degree to which this token can be subdivided. For our example we went with 2 decimal places, similar to dollars and cents.
   * The `INITIAL_SUPPLY` variable determines the number of tokens created when this contract is deployed. In this case, the number is arbitrary.

1. To finish up our contract, we'll create a constructor function to set the `totalSupply` equal to our declared `INITIAL_SUPPLY` and give the entire supply to the deploying account's address. Add this block below the content added in the previous step:

   ```javascript
   function TutorialToken() public {
     uint totalSupply = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
     balances[msg.sender] = INITIAL_SUPPLY;
   }
   ```

Using less than 15 lines of hand-coded Solidity, we've created our own Ethereum token!

## Compiling and deploying the smart contract

1. In the `migrations/` directory, create the file `2_deploy_contracts.js` and add the following content:

   ```javascript
   var TutorialToken = artifacts.require("TutorialToken");

   module.exports = function(deployer) {
     deployer.deploy(TutorialToken);
   };
   ```

   The `import` statement within our `TutorialToken` contract will be automatically handled by the compiler, along with any subsequent imports within `StandardToken`.

1. Now we are ready to compile and deploy your contract to the blockchain. For this tutorial, we will use [Ganache](/ganache), a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests. If you haven't already, [download Ganache](/ganache) and double click the icon to launch the application. This will generate a blockchain running locally on port 7545.

   ![Ganache](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-ganache-initial.png)

   *Ganache*

   <p class="alert alert-info">
     **Note**: Read more about Ganache in the [Truffle documentation](/docs/ganache/using).
   </p>

1. With our blockchain launched, head back to your terminal. Make sure you are in the root of your project's directory and then run the following command to compile the contract:

   ```shell
   truffle compile
   ```

   <p class="alert alert-info">
     <strong>Note</strong>: If you're on Windows and encountering problems running this command, please see the documentation on [resolving naming conflicts on Windows](/docs/advanced/configuration#resolving-naming-conflicts-on-windows).
   </p>

1. Once the compile has completed, deploy the contract to the blockchain:

   ```shell
   truffle migrate
   ```

   You will see output that looks similar to this:

   ```shell
   Using network 'development'.

   ```

   Ganache will also list these transactions as well.

## Interacting with the new token

For this portion of the tutorial, we recommend using [MetaMask](http://metamask.io) a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. It will allow you to switch between accounts quickly, perfect for testing the ability to transfer our newly created tokens. Our [Pet Shop tutorial](/tutorials/pet-shop) has more information about [configuring MetaMask](/tutorials/pet-shop#interacting-with-the-dapp-in-a-browser). 

You will want to enter the mnemonic displayed in Ganache into MetaMask, and make sure that MetaMask is listening to the Custom RPC `http://127.0.0.1:7545`.

<p class="alert alert-danger">
**Warning**: Do not use the Main Network in MetaMask. If you send ether to any account generated from Ganache's default mnemonic, you will lose it all!
</p>

1. Still in your terminal, run a local web server containing the front-end application:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   A browser window should automatically open with the interface below:

   ![TutorialToken Wallet](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-tutorialtoken-initial.png)

   *TutorialToken wallet*

   Our basic dapp shows the TutorialToken balance of the selected account in MetaMask.

1. Now we'll transfer some TutorialToken tokens to a different account. Ganache, when launched, lists 10 accounts. The first account has the token balance. Pick one of the other accounts (we recommend the second account) and enter it in the "Address" box, and also enter `2000` in the "Amount" field.

   ![TutorialToken Wallet transfer recipient](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-transfer-address.png)

   *TutorialToken wallet transfer recipient*

1. Click "Transfer" to initiate the token transfer. MetaMask will intercept the transfer request and display a confirmation. Note that no ether is changing hands, except for the gas used to pay for the transaction.

   ![MetaMask transaction confirmation](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-metamask-transfer.png)

   *MetaMask transaction confirmation*

1. Click "Submit" and the transfer will proceed. If all goes well, you will see a window saying "Transfer successful". You will also see a record of the transaction in MetaMask, and a new transaction will be displayed at the top of the "Transactions" section in Ganache.

   ![Ganache transactions](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-ganache-transactions.png)

   *Ganache transactions*

1. Still in MetaMask, switch from the first account to the second one (you may need to select "Create an account" if only one account is in the list.)

   ![MetaMask account select](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-metamask-account-select.png)

   *MetaMask account select*

1. Now refresh the app in your browser. It will be connected to the currently selected account in MetaMask, and display the amount of tokens (in this case, 2000 TT). This shows that the transfer did in fact succeed.

   ![TutorialToken transfer success](/tutorials/images/open-zeppelin/oz-tutorialtoken-final.png)

   *TutorialToken transfer success*

1. Try sending different amount of tokens to different accounts to practice how our dapp (and MetaMask) interacts with the network.

We at Truffle are excited to see companies like Zeppelin Solutions contributing to the standardization and increased security of smart contracts. With OpenZeppelin's contracts and Truffle's tools, you have everything you need to start creating industry-standard distributed applications.

Happy coding!
