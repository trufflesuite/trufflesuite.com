# Building & Testing a Frontend App with Truffle 3.0
[Truffle 3](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle/releases/tag/v3.0.2) is out and switched to less opinionated build process that allows any build pipeline to be plugged in. We're going to take advantage of that feature today, and build a frontend app with a custom pipeline.

## Intended Audience
This is written for those familiar with Truffle and Ethereum, who want a sense of how to structure a frontend application for easy development and testing. This example uses webpack, but familiarity with other build tools is enough background.

## What does a build process need to do in Truffle 3?
In general, simple: Turn all higher level code (like ES6, SASS, JSX, templates, etc.) into vanilla Javascript/HTML/CSS artifacts, and then move those artifacts into the `build` folder alongside our contract artifacts.

## What this tutorial does
Uses webpack to compile the application's frontend code and move the artifacts into the `build` folder.

### Getting Started
If you were using Truffle beta 3.0.0-9 or below, **do not immediately upgrade**. Read [these release notes](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle/releases/tag/v3.0.2) and the [upgrade guide](http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/upgrading-from-truffle-2-to-3) first.

Once you have Truffle 3 installed, run `truffle unbox webpack` in an **empty** directory to pull down the webpack example for this tutorial [(repository here)](https://github.com/truffle-box/webpack-box). If you're coming from Truffle 2, you'll notice your old friends `Metacoin.sol` and `ConvertLib.sol` are still there. But now, running `truffle build` does this:
```bash
root@b1c71a2e1a6e:/app# truffle build
Error building:

No build configuration specified. Cant build.

Build failed. See above.
```
That's ok! Truffle 3 is getting out of your way and letting you control the build process. Our new process is specified in `webpack.config.js`. More on this later.

### Compile, migrate, and ...
In order to interact with contracts, we need them deployed on a network! The default network is configured in `truffle.js`:
```json
...
networks: {
  development: {
    host: '127.0.0.1',
    port: 7545,
    network_id: '*' // Match any network id
  }
}
...
```
Let's get the contracts on the network:

First run `truffle compile`. This will compile the `.sol` contracts into `.json` artifacts (specified in the [`truffle-contract`](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract) library). They will appear in `build/contracts/*.json`. Now we can include contracts in our app with a simple `import` or `require` statement within the `app/javascripts/app.js` file:
```javascript
// Import our contract artifacts and turn them into usable abstractions.
import metacoin_artifacts from '../../build/contracts/MetaCoin.json'
```

Next run `truffle migrate`. This will deploy the contracts onto the default network running at `127.0.0.1:7545` as defined in `truffle.js`.

### ... (webpack) build
All that's left is to use webpack to compile the app and place it in the `build/` folder. A simple `npm run build` and we're done!. Relevant configs here:
```json
// file: package.json
...
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint ./",
    "build": "webpack",
    "dev": "webpack-dev-server"
  },
...
```
```json
// file: webpack.config.js
...
entry: './app/javascripts/app.js',
output: {
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
  filename: 'app.js'
},
plugins: [
  // Copy our app's index.html to the build folder.
  new CopyWebpackPlugin([
    { from: './app/index.html', to: 'index.html' }
  ])
],
...
```
You can find more information on webpack concepts on [Webpack's website](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). Notice we didn't *have* to use webpack here. But Truffle comes with a handy webpack demo that gets us started quickly. We _could_ replace the webpack config with a `Gruntfile`, for instance, and use Grunt instead. Truffle 3 don't care no mo'.

## The App
After building, run `npm run dev` which will serve the `build/` folder's contents on `127.0.0.1:8080`. To see it, navigate to [127.0.0.1:8080/index.html](127.0.0.1:8080/index.html). You should see:

That's it, all done! Happy Truffling!

## Extra: Webpack + Docker + Travis CI
