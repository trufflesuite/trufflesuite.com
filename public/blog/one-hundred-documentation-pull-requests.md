# One hundred documentation pull requests? Yes please.

Greetings! The Truffle team has been growing over the course of the last year. From a single developer, we are now a team of five (soon to be even more), which means that we can spread the work around.

As a new full-time member of the team, I've first taken to looking at our existing materials to ensure that everything is up-to-date and working well.

For example, our website, a public GitHub repository, had been receiving pull requests (PRs) for the better part of a year, and they had been languishing for want of someone to go through them.

We're not talking a few or even a dozen. We're talking **almost 100 PRs**.

All I can say is: **wow**.

I've been working in the open source software world for about a decade, and I've never seen so many people freely offering suggestions to documentation. As we all ruefully know, documentation can be first to go out of date and last to be updated, so knowing that our community is keeping such an eagle eye on even minute details says a lot.

And I do mean *minute details*. When one of our tutorials wrote "tag a stab" instead of "take a stab", not less than [ten of you took the time to submit pull requests](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.github.io/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20tag%20take) telling us so.

Make no mistake: this is good thing. I believe in the [Broken Windows theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) as it applies to documentation. **We want to fix up the small things now so we can maintain the larger things more easily in the future.**

We have big plans for our content here, just like we have big plans for Truffle. (Check out the new features coming in Truffle 4 (<https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.0>)!) And note that [we have since separated out the website source code to its own repository](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com) to make submissions easier for the community.

I'm happy to be part of a community that cares about what we're doing, reducing the bar to developing Ethereum dapps, and making them delicious.

As for your suggestions on how we can serve you even better? Please keep them coming. Submit a pull request to our documentation, or talk to us in our [Gitter channel](http://gitter.im/Consensys/truffle).
