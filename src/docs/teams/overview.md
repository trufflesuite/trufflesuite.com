# Truffle Teams Overview

Manage and monitor the health of your blockchain-enabled application. Truffle integrated. Built for open source and enterprise. Features include:

* Dapp Tracking and Data: Get an overview of test statuses across multiple projects at a glance. Badges give visitors to your repository the assurance your dapp's contracts pass muster.
* Zero Config Continuous Integration: With no configuration required, test on every commit for maximum confidence in your Solidity code. Truffle Teams removes environmental inconsistencies by providing a unified environment for continuous smart contract testing.
* Automated Deployments: Adding Truffle Teams to your worflow is as easy as pushing to GitHub. Execute tests automatically while freeing up developer time and system resources.
* Smart Contract Management: Monitor a deployed smart contract's transactions, state, and events. View the build history and current status in the workflow.
