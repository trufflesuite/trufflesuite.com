# Contract monitoring

Truffle Teams monitors your deployments for new transactions. You can view these transactions by going to the [detail page](/docs/teams/deployments/deployment-details) for the respective deployment.

You can either [view all the associated transactions](#viewing-all-associated-transactions) at once or only the [transactions for a specific contract](#viewing-transactions-for-a-specific-contract).

## Viewing all associated transactions

Click the **TRANSACTIONS** tab to see all transactions for all associated contracts
