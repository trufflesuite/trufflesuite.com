# Graduating Deployments

Happy with a particular deployment in **Staging**? You can select the **Graduate** option from the menu to use the same build as the basis of your deployment into Mainnet. Other than selecting a different network in MetaMask, the steps are the same! After you're done, you'll see a new deployment in the production section.
