# Sandboxes

Sandboxes are shared Ganache instances you can create with the click of a button. Convenient features of Ganache's local development experience are now available to the whole team! Each sandbox has 10 pre-funded accounts and near-instant transaction times giving your team a performant, turnkey blockchain environment without spending a single wei on transactions.

Currently, sandboxes exist in isolation of the other features of Truffle Teams. Our next iteration will allow you to target a sandbox on the Deployments screen, as well as integrate with Monitoring. Sandboxes in Truffle Teams will also be the easiest way to use live chain data in your environment via forking.

## Creating or Destroying a Sandbox

Creating a sandbox is as easy as clicking the <span class="inline-button">NEW SANDBOX</span> button. To destroy a box, click the <span class="inline-button red">DELETE</span> button for the desired sandbox.

You'll see all the details necessary to start using this sandbox, including the `mnemonic` and `network_id`. See below for complete details on [usage with Truffle](#usage-with-truffle).

## Sandbox Forking

Forking allows a sandbox to act as a live network from a given block number. We take for granted in web2 that we can get test credentials and interact with an API that will map to our production environment, but in web3 this hasnâ€™t been so easy. With a forked sandbox you can transact, deploy, test, and debug against Mainnet without spending real Ether!

To fork a network, create a new sandbox by clicking the <span class="inline-button">NEW SANDBOX</span> button. Then, check the `Enable forking` checkbox. From there, select a network and optionally provide a block number. Clicking the <span class="inline-button">CONFIRM</span> button will spin up a new Ganache instance forked from the given network and block.

## Renaming a Sandbox

By default, we generate a friendly name for each sandbox. To rename a sandbox, first click the <span class="inline-button">VIEW/EDIT</span> button. You'll see a modal with the sandbox details, including a text input with the name. Fill in the new name you would like and click the <span class="inline-button">CONFIRM</span> button to save the new name.

## Usage with Truffle

You can use sandboxes with all of Truffle's commands that work with Ganache, including: `migrate`, `console`, and `test`! Doing so requires a specific configuration of Truffle's HDWalletProvider.

In addition to providing the `mnemonic` and `network_id`, we must specify the initial account index (`0`), total number of accounts (`10`), and set the `shareNonce` option to `false`. Here's a complete example:

```
const HDWalletProvider = require("@truffle/hdwallet-provider");
const teamsMnemonic = "custom buzz situate mesh cannon number grass improve iron swim pilot cool";

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    teams: {
      provider: function() {
        return new HDWalletProvider(teamsMnemonic, "https://sandbox.truffleteams.com/ac98e539-140d-498e-818e-8284eee9d933", 0, 10, false);
      },
      network_id: 1583853263114
    }
  }
};
```
