# Graduating a deployment

If you're happy with a particular deployment, you can graduate that deployment, and use it as the basis of your deployment into Mainnet. Other than selecting a different network in MetaMask, the steps are the same! To graduate a deployment, it depends which view you are using on the **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>** page: [card](#card-view) or [table](#table-view).

### Card view

Under the **Staging** column, click on the 3 vertical dots of your chosen deployment. Select the **GRADUATE** option from the menu to use the same build as the basis of your deployment into Mainnet. After you're done, you'll see a new deployment in the production section.

### Table view

If you're using the table view, you can simply click on the **ACTIONS** dropdown, and click **Graduate** on the deployment of your choice.
