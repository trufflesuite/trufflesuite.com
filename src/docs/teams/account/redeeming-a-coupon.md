Redeeming a coupon for a Truffle Teams paid subscription is different for new and existing subscriptions. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully to make sure your coupon is applied correctly. If at any point you need some help, please don't hesitate to [ask us a question](/docs/teams/support/ask-us-a-question).

## New Subscriptions

Before you can continue below, you'll need to make sure you have [created an account](/docs/teams/getting-started/creating-an-account) **and** [added at least one repository](/docs/teams/getting-started/adding-repositories) for the GitHub user/organization you'd like to apply your coupon code for.

Once you've made sure the account you'd like to apply the coupon for exists, navigate to the <a href="https://my.truffleteams.com/#/settings" target="_blank">settings</a> page. You can also navigate there by clicking on your avatar/username in the sidebar.

Next, click on the GitHub user or organization in the sidebar that you'd like to redeem the coupon for.

You should see that **FREE** is your current plan like the below picture; if it is not, please follow the instructions in the [existing subscriptions](#existing-subscriptions) section.

You can then checkout as normal with your Credit/Debit Card or PayPal account. You will not be charged today; this information will be used to renew your subscription after 1 month.

## Existing Subscriptions

If you already have a paid subscription that you'd like to redeem the coupon towards your next billing cycle, please fill out the <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1swjEgFE8RgKszFUT0UAblQ34pbp" target="_blank">existing subscription coupon form</a>.

You will need to provide the account name you'd like to apply the coupon to. This is usually the GitHub user/organization name. For example, to apply a coupon for the `https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle` repo, the account name would be **trufflesuite**.

You can also go to https://my.truffleteams.com/#/settings and give the name of the account as it is written in the sidebar.
