# External CI

To enable external CI for a repository, navigate to your user or organizationâ€™s settings page by clicking the user/organization icon in the navbar. From there, click the `BUILDS` tab, then check the checkbox next to the repository of your choice.

Now, when you navigate to the builds page for that repository, any new builds will show a list of your GitHub-integrated build services, along with their respective statuses.
