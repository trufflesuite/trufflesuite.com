# External CI

To enable external CI for a repository, navigate to your user or organization’s settings page by clicking the user/org icon in the navbar. From there, click the BUILDS tab, then check the checkbox next to the repository of your choice.

Now, when you navigate to the builds page for that repository, any new builds will show a list of your GitHub-integrated build services, along with their respective statuses.
