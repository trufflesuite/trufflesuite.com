# Starting Builds

Builds will start automatically once a new commit is pushed to any branch of a repository added to Truffle Teams. You will see the build queued in both the Truffle Teams interface on the `BUILDS` page and on GitHub with the commit itself.

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note</strong>: Truffle Teams will only build repositories who have a Truffle project at the root of the repository. It looks for a <code>truffle-config.js</code> or <code>truffle.js</code> config in the root directory before building. Read more in the <a href="/docs/teams/reference/configuration#repository-structure">Configuration docs</a>.

## Restarting Builds

If for whatever reason the build failed and you want to restart a build, it is possible to manually retrigger the build by clicking `Restart Build` next to the specific build on the `BUILDS` page. Note: the `Restart Build` button will be disabled for any in progress builds or builds using an external CI provider (such as Travis or Circle) as you would have to restart the build through your external CI providers interface.
