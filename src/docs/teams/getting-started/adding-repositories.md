# Adding Repositories

The first time you sign in to Truffle Teams, GitHub will prompt you to install it on one or more repositories. In some cases you may want to add a repository after initial installation. For example, if it's been created after signing up for Truffle Teams.

To add a repository to Truffle Teams, navigate to <a href="https://my.truffleteams.com" target="_blank">https://my.truffleteams.com</a> (this link will open in a new window). Click `LOGIN WITH GITHUB` and once you've successfully logged in you'll be redirected to the Truffle Teams home page. Once logged in, you can also click on the `Truffle Teams` logo in the top right corner of any page to be redirected to the home page. From there you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click <span class="inline-button">ADD REPOSITORY</span>, this will take you to the Truffle Teams GitHub app page where you can select which repositories you would like to add to Teams.

Once you've selected one or more repositories, click the green `Save` button. You'll be redirected to the top of the Truffle Teams settings page for this owner with a confirmation message.

You can now navigate back to Truffle Teams to see your newly added repository!

<p class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Note</strong>: Truffle Teams will only build repositories who have a Truffle project at the root of the repository. It looks for a <code>truffle-config.js</code> or <code>truffle.js</code> config in the root directory before building. Read more in the <a href="/docs/teams/reference/configuration#repository-structure">Configuration docs</a>.
