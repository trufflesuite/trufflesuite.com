# Adding Repositories

The first time you sign in to Truffle Teams, GitHub will prompt you to install it on one or more repositories. In some cases you may want to add a repository after initial installation. For example, if it's been created after siging up for Truffle Teams.

To add a repository to Truffle Teams, navigate to <a href="https://my.truffleteams.com" target="_blank">https://my.truffleteams.com</a> (this link will open in a new window). Click `LOGIN WITH GITHUB` and once you've successfully logged in you'll be redirected to the Truffle Teams home page. Once logged in, you can also click on the `Truffle Teams` logo in the top right corner of any page to be redirected to the home page. From there you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click <span class="inline-button">ADD REPOSITORY</span>, this will take you to the Truffle Teams GitHub app page where you can select which repositories you would like to add to Teams.
