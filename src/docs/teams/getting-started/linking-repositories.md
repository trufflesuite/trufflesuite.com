The first time you sign in to Truffle Teams, GitHub will prompt you to install it on one or more repositories. In some cases you may want to add a repository after intial installation. For example, if it's been created after siging up for Truffle Teams.

To add a repository to Truffle Teams, click the <span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i>BUILDS</span> link in the sidebar if you're not already in the `BUILDS` area. Then, click the <span class="inline-button">ADD REPOSITORY</span> buttton in the upper-right corner to be taken to the Truffle Teams GitHub App page.
