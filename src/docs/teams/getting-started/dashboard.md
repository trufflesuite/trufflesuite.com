# Dashboard

The Truffle Teams dashboard allows you to get at-a-glance information about the health of a deployed DApp such as a link to the commit which was deployed, the cost of your deployment, and transactions over time.

## Getting Started

To get started with the dashboard, first you will need to select a repository and [deploy your DApp](/docs/teams/deployments/deploying-contracts). Once you have a deployment available, you can select that deployment to monitor via the dashboard by clicking the <span class="inline-button">ADD DEPLOYMENT</span> button.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  These instructions assume you have already created a Teams account. For documentation on how to get your Teams account up and running, see

Once you have added a deployment to monitor, you will be taken to the main dashboard page.

## Switching Deployments

As your DApp matures and changes, you may find you want to change the deployment you are monitoring with the dashboard. To do this, simply click the <span class="inline-button">SWITCH DEPLOYMENT</span> button at the upper right of the dashboard screen. Once you have opened the deploymemt choice modal, pick the deployment you wish to monitor.

<p class="alert alert-info">
  If you are working on a DApp with a team of developers, changing the dashboard deployment
  will make the change for all developers on your team.
