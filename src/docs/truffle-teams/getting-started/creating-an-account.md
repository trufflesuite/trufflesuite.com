# Creating an Account

To start, navigate to <a href="https://my.truffleteams.com" target="_blank">https://my.truffleteams.com</a> (this link will open in a new window).

If you're not already logged in to your GitHub account, Github will prompt you to do so.

If you are a member of any organizations other than your personal account, you'll be prompted to select an org to contiue with installation. Orgs with an existing Truffle Teams installation will have a `Configure >` link.
