# Overview

Drizzle is a collection of front-end libraries that make writing dapp front-ends easier and more predictable. The core of Drizzle is based on a Redux store, so you have access to the spectacular development tools around Redux. We take care of synchronizing your contract data, transaction data and more. Things stay fast because you declare what to keep in sync.

- Fully reactive contract data, including state, events and transactions.
- Declarative, so you're not wasting valuable cycles on unneeded data.
- Maintains access to underlying functionality. Web3 and your contract's methods are still there, untouched.
