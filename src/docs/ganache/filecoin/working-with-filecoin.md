# Working With Filecoin

Ganache supports development with [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io), a decentralized storage network with built-in incentives.

It is highly recommended you checkout the <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official Filecoin development documentation</a> before getting started with Filecoin-flavored Ganache.

The documentation is split up by target use; each page goes over respective installation, usage, and configuration:
- [CLI](./get-started-with-the-cli)
- [GUI](./get-started-with-the-gui)
- [NodeJS](./get-started-with-nodejs)
