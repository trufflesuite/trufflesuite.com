# Editing Workspaces

To edit a workspace without loading it first, from the home screen, hover over the workspace name and click the settings icon on the right hand side. You'll then be able to [reconfigure your existing workspace](/docs/ganache/workspaces/creating-workspaces#workspace-configuration).
