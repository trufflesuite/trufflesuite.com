# Unlinking a Truffle Project

If you no longer want a Truffle project linked to a workspace, go to the `WORKSPACE` settings pane the same way you did when [linking the project](/docs/ganache/truffle-projects/linking-a-truffle-project).

To remove/unlink a Truffle project from the workspace, click on the project file in the `TRUFFLE PROJECTS` list and then click the `REMOVE PROJECT` button.

When you're done, click the `SAVE AND RESTART` (`SAVE WORKSPACE` if this is a new workspace) button in the top right.
