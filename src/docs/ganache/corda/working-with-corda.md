It is highly recommended you checkout the <a href="https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">official corda development documentation</a> before getting started with Corda-flavored Ganache.

If you haven't yet installed or updated Ganache to v2.4.0 or later go to [Ganache Quickstart](/docs/ganache/quickstart). If you already have Ganache v2.4.0 or later installed head over to the [Corda Workspace Overview](./workspace-overview).
