# Shell

<p class="alert alert-info">For Corda technical documentation not related to Ganache head over to <a href="https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4.html">Corda's official documentation</a>.</p>

The Corda Shell screen provides Corda CRaSH shell access to each node and notary. You can issue commands such as `flow list`, `dashboard`, `run gracefulShutdown`, etc!

The shell updates in real-time, just as if you SSHed into the shell yourself:
