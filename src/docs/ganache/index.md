# Overview

[Ganache](/ganache) is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Corda distributed application development. You can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.

Ganache comes in two flavors: a Ganache UI and Ganache v7. Ganache UI is a desktop application supporting both Ethereum and Corda technology. [Ganache v7](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) is an Ethereum simulator and JSON-RPC provider that can be used in the command line, programmatically as a Node package, and in the browser. To see documentation on the UI flavor of Ganache, check out the [UI Reference Guide](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/reference/ganache-settings/). See [the Ganache Github](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/#--) for documentation on Ganache v7.

All versions of Ganache are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
