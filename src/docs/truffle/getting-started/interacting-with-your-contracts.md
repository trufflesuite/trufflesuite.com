# Interacting with your contracts

## Introduction

If you were writing raw requests to the Ethereum network yourself in order to interact with your contracts, you'd soon realize that writing these requests is clunky and cumbersome. As well, you might find that managing the state for each request you've made is _complicated_. Fortunately, Truffle takes care of this complexity for you, to make interacting with your contracts a breeze.

## Reading and writing data

The Ethereum network makes a distinction between writing data to the network and reading data from it, and this distinction plays a significant part in how you write your application. In general, writing data is called a **transaction** whereas reading data is called a **call**. Transactions and calls are treated very differently, and have the following characteristics.

### Transactions

Transactions fundamentally change the state of the network. A transaction can be as simple as sending Ether to another account, or as complicated as executing a contract function or adding a new contract to the network. The defining characteristic of a transaction is that it writes (or changes) data. Transactions cost Ether to run, known as "gas", and transactions take time to process. When you execute a contract's function via a transaction, you cannot receive that function's return value because the transaction isn't processed immediately. In general, functions meant to be executed via a transaction will not return a value; they will return a transaction id instead. So in summary, transactions:

* Cost gas (Ether)
* Change the state of the network
* Aren't processed immediately
* Won't expose a return value (only a transaction id).

### Calls

Calls, on the other hand, are very different. Calls can be used to execute code on the network, though no data will be permanently changed. Calls are free to run, and their defining characteristic is that they read data. When you execute a contract function via a call you will receive the return value immediately. In summary, calls:

* Are free (do not cost gas)
* Do not change the state of the network
* Are processed immediately
* Will expose a return value (hooray!)

Choosing between a transaction and a call is as simple as deciding whether you want to read data, or write it.

## Introducing abstractions

Contract abstractions are the bread and butter of interacting with Ethereum contracts from Javascript. In short, contract abstractions are wrapper code that makes interaction with your contracts easy, in a way that lets you forget about the many engines and gears executing under the hood. Truffle uses its own contract abstraction via the [@truffle/contract](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/master/packages/contract) module, and it is this contract abstraction that's described below.

In order to appreciate the usefulness of a contract abstraction, however, we first need a contract to talk about. We'll use the MetaCoin contract available to you through Truffle Boxes via `truffle unbox metacoin`.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.4.25 <0.6.0;

import "./ConvertLib.sol";

// This is just a simple example of a coin-like contract.
// It is not standards compatible and cannot be expected to talk to other
// coin/token contracts. If you want to create a standards-compliant
// token, see: https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens. Cheers!

contract MetaCoin {
	mapping (address => uint) balances;

	event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);

	constructor() public {
		balances[tx.origin] = 10000;
	}

	function sendCoin(address receiver, uint amount) public returns(bool sufficient) {
		if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return false;
		balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
		balances[receiver] += amount;
		emit Transfer(msg.sender, receiver, amount);
		return true;
	}

	function getBalanceInEth(address addr) public view returns(uint){
		return ConvertLib.convert(getBalance(addr),2);
	}

	function getBalance(address addr) public view returns(uint) {
		return balances[addr];
	}
}
```

This contract has three methods aside from the constructor (`sendCoin`, `getBalanceInEth`, and `getBalance`). All three methods can be executed as either a transaction or a call.

Now let's look at the Javascript object called `MetaCoin` provided for us by Truffle, as made available in the [Truffle console](/docs/truffle/getting-started/using-truffle-develop-and-the-console):

```javascript
truffle(develop)> let instance = await MetaCoin.deployed()
truffle(develop)> instance

// outputs:
//
// Contract
// - address: "0xa9f441a487754e6b27ba044a5a8eb2eec77f6b92"
// - allEvents: ()
// - getBalance: ()
// - getBalanceInEth: ()
// - sendCoin: ()
// ...
```

Notice that the abstraction contains the exact same functions that exist within our contract. It also contains an address which points to the deployed version of the MetaCoin contract.

## Executing contract functions

Using the abstraction you can easily execute contract functions on the Ethereum network.

### Making a transaction

There are three functions on the MetaCoin contract that we can execute. If you analyze each of them, you'll see that `sendCoin` is the only function that aims to make changes to the network. The goal of `sendCoin` is to "send" some Meta coins from one account to the next, and these changes should persist.

When calling `sendCoin`, we'll execute it as a transaction. In the following example, we'll send 10 Meta coin from one account to another, in a way that persists changes on the network:

```javascript
truffle(develop)> let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts()
truffle(develop)> instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 10, {from: accounts[0]})
```

There are a few things interesting about the above code:

* We called the abstraction's `sendCoin` function directly. This will result in a transaction by default (i.e, writing data) instead of call.
* We passed an object as the third parameter to `sendCoin`. Note that the `sendCoin` function in our Solidity contract doesn't have a third parameter. What you see above is a special object that can always be passed as the last parameter to a function that lets you edit specific details about the transaction ("transaction params"). Here, we set the `from` address ensuring this transaction came from `accounts[0]`.  The transaction params that you can set correspond to the fields in an Ethereum transaction:
    * `from`
    * `to`
    * `gas`
    * `gasPrice`
    * `value`
    * `data`
    * `nonce`

### Making a call

Continuing with MetaCoin, notice the `getBalance` function is a great candidate for reading data from the network. It doesn't need to make any changes, as it just returns the MetaCoin balance of the address passed to it. Let's give it a shot:

```javascript
truffle(develop)> let balance = await instance.getBalance(accounts[0])
truffle(develop)> balance.toNumber()
```

What's interesting here:

* We received a return value. Note that since the Ethereum network can handle very large numbers, we're given a [BN](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js/) object which we then convert to a number.

<p class="alert alert-warning">
**Warning**: We convert the return value to a number because in this example the numbers are small. However, if you try to convert a BN that's larger than the largest integer supported by Javascript, you'll likely run into errors or unexpected behavior.
</p>

### Processing transaction results

When you make a transaction, you're given a `result` object that gives you a wealth of information about the transaction.

```javascript
truffle(develop)> let result = await instance.sendCoin(accounts[1], 10, {from: accounts[0]})
truffle(develop)> result
```

Specifically, you get the following:

* `result.tx` *(string)* - Transaction hash
* `result.logs` *(array)* - Decoded events (logs)
* `result.receipt` *(object)* - Transaction receipt (includes the amount of gas used)

For more information, please see the [README](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/master/packages/contract) in the `@truffle/contract` package.

### Catching events

Your contracts can fire events that you can catch to gain more insight into what your contracts are doing. The easiest way to handle events is by processing the `logs` array contained within `result` object of the transaction that triggered the event.

If we explicitly output the first log entry we can see the details of the event that was emitted as part of the `sendCoin` call (`Transfer(msg.sender, receiver, amount);`).

```javascript
truffle(develop)> result.logs[0]
{ logIndex: 0,
  transactionIndex: 0,
  transactionHash: '0x3b33960e99416f687b983d4a6bb628d38bf7855c6249e71d0d16c7930a588cb2',
  blockHash: '0xe36787063e114a763469e7dabc7aa57545e67eb2c395a1e6784988ac065fdd59',
  blockNumber: 8,
  address: '0x6891Ac4E2EF3dA9bc88C96fEDbC9eA4d6D88F768',
  type: 'mined',
  id: 'log_3181e274',
  event: 'Transfer',
  args:
   Result {
     '0': '0x8128880DC48cde7e471EF6b99d3877357bb93f01',
     '1': '0x12B6971f6eb35dD138a03Bd6cBdf9Fc9b9a87d7e',
     '2': <BN: a>,
     __length__: 3,
     _from: '0x8128880DC48cde7e471EF6b99d3877357bb93f01',
     _to: '0x12B6971f6eb35dD138a03Bd6cBdf9Fc9b9a87d7e',
     _value: <BN: a> } }
```

### Add a new contract to the network

In all of the above cases, we've been using a contract abstraction that has already been deployed. We can deploy our own version to the network using the `.new()` function:

```javascript
truffle(develop)> let newInstance = await MetaCoin.new()
truffle(develop)> newInstance.address
'0x64307b67314b584b1E3Be606255bd683C835A876'
```

### Use a contract at a specific address

If you already have an address for a contract, you can create a new abstraction to represent the contract at that address.

```javascript
let specificInstance = await MetaCoin.at("0x1234...");
```

### Sending ether to a contract

You may simply want to send Ether directly to a contract, or trigger a contract's [fallback function](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#fallback-function). You can do so using one of the following two options.

Option 1: Send a transaction directly to a contract via `instance.sendTransaction()`. This is promisified like all available contract instance functions, and has the same API as `web3.eth.sendTransaction` but without the callback. The `to` value will be automatically filled in for you if not specified.

```javascript
instance.sendTransaction({...}).then(function(result) {
  // Same transaction result object as above.
});
```

Option 2: There's also shorthand for just sending Ether directly:

```javascript
instance.send(web3.utils.toWei(1, "ether")).then(function(result) {
  // Same result object as above.
});
```

### Special methods on Truffle contract objects

There are a couple of special functions that you can find on the actual contract
methods of your contract abstractions:

- `estimateGas`
- `sendTransaction`
- `call`

The first special method mentioned above is the `estimateGas` method. This, as you
probably can guess, estimates the amount of gas that a transaction will require.
If we wanted to estimate the gas for a transaction, we would call it on the
contract method itself. It would look something like the following:

```javascript
const instance = await MyContract.deployed();
const amountOfGas = await instance.sendTokens.estimateGas(4, myAccount);
```

This will give us an estimate of how much gas it will take to run the
transaction specified.

Note that the arguments above (`4` and `myAccount`) correspond to whatever the
signature of the contract method happens to be.

Another useful thing to note is that you can also call this on a contract's
new method to see how much gas it will take to deploy. So you would do
`Contract.new.estimateGas()` to get the gas estimate for the contract's deployment.

The next mentioned method is `sendTransaction`. In general, if you execute a
contract method, Truffle will intelligently figure out whether it needs
to make a transaction or a call. If your function can be executed
as a call, then Truffle will do so and you will be able to avoid gas costs.

There may be some scenarios, however, where you want to force Truffle to
make a transaction. In these cases, you can use the `sendTransaction`
method found on the method itself. This would look something
like `instance.myMethod.sendTransaction()`.

For example, suppose I have a contract instance with the method
`getTokenBalance`. I could do the following to force a transaction to take
place while executing `getTokenBalance`:

```javascript
const instance = await MyContract.deployed();
const result = await instance.getTokenBalance.sendTransaction(myAccount);
```

The `result` variable above will be the same kind of result you would get
from executing any normal transaction in Truffle. It will contain the
transaction hash, the logs, etc.

The last method is `call` and the syntax is exactly the same as for
`sendTransaction`. If you want to explicitly make a call, you can
use the `call` method found on your contract abstraction's method. So you
would write something that looks like
`const result = await instance.myMethod.call()`.

### Invoking overloaded methods

The current implementation of Truffle's contract abstraction can mistakenly
infer the signature of an overloaded method even though it exists in the
contract ABI.

Therefore, some methods may not be accessible through the contract's
instance, but their accessors can be invoked explicitly via the `.methods`
property of the contract.

```javascript
const instance = await MyContract.deployed();
instance.methods['setValue(uint256)'](123);
instance.methods['setValue(uint256,uint256)'](11, 55);
```
