# Writing External Scripts

Often you may want to run external scripts that interact with your contracts. Truffle provides an easy way to do this, bootstrapping your contracts based on your desired network and connecting to your Ethereum client automatically per your [project configuration](/docs/advanced/configuration).

## Command

To run an external script, perform the following:

```
$ truffle exec <path/to/file.js>
```

## File structure

In order for external scripts to be run correctly, Truffle expects them to export a function that takes a single parameter as a callback:

```javascript
module.exports = function(callback) {
  // perform actions
}
```

You can do anything you'd like within this script, so long as the callback is called when the script finishes. The callback accepts an error as its first and only parameter. If an error is provided, execution will halt and the process will return a non-zero exit code.


# Third-party plugin commands

<p class="alert alert-warning">
**Note**: This feature is new and still in a barebones state. Please let us
know how we can improve it!
</p>

## Plugin installation / usage

1. Install the plugin from NPM.
   ```
   npm install --save-dev truffle-plugin-hello
   ```

2. Add a <code>plugins</code> section to your Truffle config.
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     /* ... rest of truffle-config */

     plugins: [
       "truffle-plugin-hello"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Run the command
   ```
   $ truffle run hello
   Hello, World!
   ```


## Creating a custom command plugin

1. Implement the command as a Node module with a function as its default export.

   Example: `hello.js`

   ```javascript
   /**
    * Outputs `Hello, World!` when running `truffle run hello`,
    * or `Hello, ${name}` when running `truffle run hello [name]`
    * @param {Config} config - A truffle-config object.
    * Has attributes like `truffle_directory`, `working_directory`, etc.
    */
   module.exports = async (config) => {
     // config._ has the command arguments.
     // config_[0] is the command name, e.g. "hello" here.
     // config_[1] starts remaining parameters.
     if (config.help) {
       console.log(`Usage: truffle run hello [name]`);
       done(null, [], []);	
       return;
     }

     let name = config._.length > 1 ? config._[1] : 'World!';
     console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
   }
   ```

2.  Define a `truffle-plugin.json` file to specify the command.
    Example: <code>truffle-plugin.json</code>

    ```json
    {
      "commands": {
        "hello": "hello.js"
      }
    }
    ```

3.  Publish to NPM

    ```
    npm publish
    ```
