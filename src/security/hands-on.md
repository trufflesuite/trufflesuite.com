# Hands On

In this section we get hands on, exploring real vulnerabilities and their associated mitigations. We also start to explore a number of tools and services that are a critical part of the Dapp security lifecycle.

Note that the goal isn’t meant to be 100% comprehensive, but to start building your intuition and add new tools to your arsenal. This is also a “living” collection so we’ll be adding new vulnerability examples as and when they are discovered. We also very much welcome contributions!

## Introducing the Web3 Security Starter Box

You can get started by going to [truffle-box/security-starter-box](https://github.com/truffle-box/security-starter-box) and following the steps in the accompanying [README](https://github.com/truffle-box/security-starter-box/blob/main/README.md).

The repo uses a monorepo wherein each workspace is a standalone project. 

- **hackd-dapp** - A tutorial on how hacked code or front end deps can be bad for your health and wallet balances
- **vulnerable-defi** - Examples of defi (courtesy of DamnVulnerableDeFi) contracts with vulnerabilities with different tests and examples of mitigation
- **common-contracts** - A collection of vulnerable contracts with accompanying mitigations
