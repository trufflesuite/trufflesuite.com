# Tools & Resources

In this section we aggregate a collection of security focused guides, tools, and registries. As with everything in this guide, it’s designed to be a living list and we very much welcome suggestions or contributions. 

## Smart Contract Security

- [Smart Contract Weakness (SWC) Classification Registry](https://swcregistry.io) - These SWC codes are used in Mythril and Scribble to classify issues with your Smart Contracts 
- [Ethereum Foundations’s guide to Smart Contract Security](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/security/)
- Halborn’s series on DeFi security
  - [Part #1 - Data Security Vulnerabilities](https://halborn.com/defi-security-part-1-data-security-vulnerabilities/)
  - [Part #2 - Consensus Vulnerabilities](https://halborn.com/defi-security-part-2-consensus-vulnerabilities/)
  - [Part #3 - Smart Contract Vulnerabilities](https://halborn.com/defi-security-part-3-smart-contract-vulnerabilities/)
- [Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/) - Written by ConsenSys Diligence this reference gives you a lot of good information to start you on your journey

## Tools

- [Diligence Security Tooling Guide](https://consensys.net/diligence/resources/security-tooling-guide/) - An in-depth overview of ConsenSys Diligence’s toolset (and beyond).Scribble runs checks on your smart contract code and looks for possible issues that might not always be caught with normal tests. Scribble uses a technique called Fuzzing which runs lots of tests in focused ways across your code that has been annotated with special Scribble commands/assertions
- [Vertigo](https://github.com/JoranHonig/vertigo) - Vertigo is a mutation testing framework designed to work specifically for smart contracts. This mutation testing framework implements a range of mutation operators that are either selected from previous works or tailored to solidity.

## Personal & Team Security

- [Metamask - Common scams and how to avoid them](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412217080091-Common-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them)

## News

- [Rekt News](https://rekt.news) - A website showing you what can really go wrong. It’s quite amusing to read but I’m sure the people they write about don’t really see it that way, nor the people who got rugged or their money drained from poorly written code. Please read a few and see how bad things can get
