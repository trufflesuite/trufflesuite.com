## Welcome

Welcome to Truffle + Security, our living guide to helping individuals and teams building on web3 get, and stay, secure. Contained within, you’ll find a range of best practices on securing individuals, teams, environments and code.

We’ve built this guide to breadth-focused (which was something we felt lacking in the ecosystem), with the goal being a holistic appreciation of all aspects of web3 security. It’s also designed for technical and non-technical users alike, with clear labels specifying the audience a given section is intended for.

For technical users (such as developers, auditors, etc), while we do cover common contract vulnerabilities and mitigations, broader attack vectors, and security tooling, we do not try to be completely comprehensive. Instead we aim to fill in knowledge gaps and provide links in our Tools & Resources section to enable you to go deeper on a given topic.

Lastly, as stated, this is very much intended to be a “living guide” and we’d love [feedback](https://github.com/orgs/trufflesuite/discussions/categories/security) or contributions. With that let’s dive right into our manifesto on web3 security.

## Manifesto on Web3 Security

!!! quote

    Dear web3 builder,

    At Truffle, it’s our ongoing mission to create best-in-class tools and services that make the decentralized application (dapp) development process as simple and efficient as possible. While security is always at the forefront of our minds in everything we do, a confluence of factors have led us to decide it was time to double down on that commitment.

    These factors have included, although are by no means limited to, the following:
    
    - **More at stak** - projects (and their underlying contracts) are storing larger amounts of value making them [increasingly attractive targets](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23199148/web3-lost-2-billion-hacks-flash-loan-certik-cryptocurrency)
    - **More hacks** - sadly it’s often feels like hardly a day goes by without a hack or exploit [making the headlines](https://rekt.news/)
    - **More developers** - while this is an undeniably positive trend, it also means there’s new people entering the ecosystem with minimal experience with securing their projects
    - **More complexity** - increased complexity (scaling solutions, bridges, etc) is resulting in more attack vectors 
    - **Loss of Credibility** - The more hacks and money stolen feeds into the media’s negative portrayal of the blockchain industry.

    So what does this commitment mean? Firstly, we are committed to being the most secure suite of tools in the ecosystem. This might not mean you use Truffle for every stage of your workflow (although of course it’s fine if you do), but if we’re successful, we’ll make it as easy as it can be to ensure that every aspect of your project is adequately hardened. We’ll be doing this in a number of ways:

    - **Content** - As this section highlights, we’ll be creating new content focusing on a range of areas from securing yourself and your team in more “traditional” terms through to something we’re calling the 12 Factor Dapp in a nod to [the SaaS equivalent](https://12factor.net/)
    - **Tooling** - We’ll be reviewing all our tools to see how we can appropriately surface all the major aspects of the security lifecycle into the workflow
    - **Integrations** - We’ll be partnering with teams across industry (starting with [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/)) to more seamlessly integrate their tools and services into the Dapp SDLC  
    - **Community** - That includes you :) We’d love to start the conversation around any ideas you might have on improving the status quo 

    As mentioned, we’d love to hear your ideas. If anything jumps out, head on over to our Github Discussion on this topic and share your thoughts. Beyond that, feel free to dive into the content below and let's make hacks, exploits, and vulnerabilities a thing of the past!  

    Yours securely,
    The Truffle Team
