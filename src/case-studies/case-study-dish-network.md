## The Solution

DISH partnered with Truffle Suite to co-develop a long form training program to train DISH’s existing software engineering on blockchain. The program syllabus included the development lifecycle, smart contract development, tokenization, and decentralized identity. Rob Steiner, Head of Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology at Dish says "I’m trying to get our massive team of engineers up to speed. We need to demystify the tech. Truffle does that."
