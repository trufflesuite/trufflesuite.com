## The Problem

A Seattle based coffee company wanted to provide their customers with more transparency while creating financial opportunities for their coffee bean farmers.

## The Solution

They launched a pilot program with select coffee farmers to develop a blockchain based system to share real-time information along the journey of coffee beans and open up potential financial opportunities for coffee bean farmers at the other end.

Using a smartphone customers can scan a code on the back of coffee bags for an immutable record, built with the help of Truffle Suite tools, to view the coffee's history. The record includes information about where beans are grown, Seattle Coffee's support efforts for farmers in that region, where the beans were roasted, tasting notes, and more. The goal is to create greater empowerment for farmers and coffee drinkers can better understand where their coffee came from with real-time and transparents data.
