If you read my [blog post back in July](/blog/an-easier-way-to-deploy-your-smart-contracts), attended my TruffleCon workshop `Push It! Push It Real Good: Truffle Teams Intro & Deployments` back in August, or tuned in last week to my `Truffle Teams Overview` webinar, you've known something awesome has been in the works for Truffle Teams.

Well it's finally here, and on behalf of the whole team I'm proud to announce Deployments within Truffle Teams!

## Bridging the Gap Between Local Ganache Testing and Public Testnet/Mainnet Deployments

The interaction between Truffle and Ganache provides an awesome testing experience to iteratively test and fix contracts on a personal Ethereum blockchain. However, it can be a little tricky when you're ready to publish your application to the rest of the world. That's where Truffle Teams Deployments comes in. We give you a **dead-simple deployment experience** which links with MetaMask so you never need to export your private keys.

## Benefits of Deploying with Truffle Teams

- **Easily deploy to public Ethereum networks** (Mainnet, Ropsten, and Rinkeby initially supported; Görli and Kovan shortly following)
- **Works with your existing migration scripts** in your Truffle project; Truffle Teams use `truffle migrate` under the hood
- **No need to export/import private keys** — use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to deploy like you would with any other dapp
- **Deploy with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) hardware wallets** within MetaMask
