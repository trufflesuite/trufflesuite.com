</p>

After a 2 year long road, we're sunsetting Truffle Teams (effective September 10th, 2021). 

The journey began when Truffle was an independent company. It extended our reach from dapp development into dapp maintenance. We've gained valuable insights about the state of blockchain devops, the most desirable parts of our tools, and a new clarity around our core competencies.

As an independent company, Truffle Teams was integral to building a business for the long-term, but it came with some costly tradeoffs. Over time the resources required to develop and maintain it were too great, taking time away from development of our open-source tools and eventually taking time away from supporting tasks like ecosystem engagement and development. This was unsustainable.

Another important factor made this sunsetting possible: The acquisition of Truffle Suite by ConsenSys Software granted us greater supporting resources and freed us from monetary metrics. Which leads us to some good news! We are reaffirming our commitment to having the best-in-class open-source blockchain developer tools.

## The afterlife is open-source

Parts of Truffle Teams will be making their way into our open-source tools! We're happy to share one right now--repackaging the visual debugger as a plugin that allows you to launch an instance from within Truffle. Truffle Teams provided greater context around your dapps activity thanks to its GUI. Being able to pull up a list of transactions from a Ganache instance, filter by failures, and clicking a debug button was one of the better workflows that we're proud to integrate with our open-source suite.

These repurposed bits will all be open-source, so you can [check out the `truffle-plugin-debugger` repository here.](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-plugin-debugger)

If there are other features you'd like to see again, for example the deployments screen or contract manager, let us know!
