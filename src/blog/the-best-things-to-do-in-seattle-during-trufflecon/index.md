## [Black Raven Brewing Company](https://www.blackravenbrewing.com/)

Black Raven is a neighborhood brewery with a friendly retail taproom, The Raven's Nest, with locations in both Redmond and Woodinville. The Raven's Nest is not a traditional brewpub; it's more like our brewery's living room.

## [Mac & Jack's Brewing](https://www.macandjacks.com/)

## [Paragliding](https://www.tigermountainparagliding.com/fly-tandem/)

Come paraglide tandem with us, and experience free flight in its purest form! After running down a moderately steep hill you'll find yourself airborne, sitting comfortably in a reclined harness, your feet dangling above the trees, no one in front of you (pilot rides in back) and no cockpit surrounding you.

Depending on conditions you'll have views of Mt. Rainier, Mt. Si, Lake Sammamish, Bellevue, Seattle, the Puget Sound and so much more. Bald eagles and other predators leave their nests to ride the same thermals allowing you to literally fly with birds.

## [DirtFish Rally Driving School](https://www.dirtfish.com/)

Nestled in the foothills of the Cascade Mountain Range in the scenic town of Snoqualmie, WA, DirtFish Rally School was established in 2010 with the idea that the exciting sport of rally should be accessible to everyone. Armed with an immaculate fleet of turbocharged, all-wheel-drive cars, right from the beginning DirtFish was equipped to share with anyone the excitement of what a real rally car can do on a loose surface. In the fall of 2014, DirtFish embellished their offerings with the launch of rear-wheel drive programs. Similar in nature to the all-wheel drive programs, the precise and very sideways action the classes offer provides an entirely different challenge for drivers of every background. Ever since, DirtFish has become the most prestigious rally school in North America, providing the highest level of instruction, top level cars and gorgeous facilities all year round.

## [Hiking](https://www.wta.org/)

Hiking in nature has a positive impact on people's hearts, minds and bodies. It is vital for everyone to have the opportunity to access the outdoors, and the WTA is committed to reducing barriers to hiking trails and lands. We strive to inspire people to go outside—giving them the skills and knowledge they need to recreate safely and sustainably.

People will protect the places they love to hike. WTA rallies hikers to raise our collective voice to protect the places we love. Our voice is amplified by the support of our members and sweat equity of every volunteer who helps to build and maintain trails.
