As part of our [collaboration with Microsoft](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-expands-blockchain-service-capabilities-on-microsoft-azure/), we are excited to announce that we are taking on the maintenance and evolution of the **Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum**, which is now known as **Truffle for VSCode**.

If you're not familiar with the extension, it's designed to help [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) users *create, build and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum ledgers using the Trufflesuite of tools*. It also integrates with an array of popular projects and services such as [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) and [Infura](https://infura.io/).

## Getting Started

If you already have the previous version of the extension installed, you should see a dialog prompting you to make the switch. Simply click "Upgrade now" and you'll be switched over, with the previous version being automatically uninstalled.

Alternatively, if you're new to the extension, you can search for "*Truffle*" in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) and simply click install. More details are also available [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trufflesuite-csi.trufflesuite-vscode).

## What's Next & Feedback

We're going to be iterating rapidly, with a updated version of the [Truffle debugger](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/using-the-truffle-debugger) available at launch and [large pipeline](https://github.com/trufflesuite/vscode-ext/issues) of new upcoming features and enhancements.

In addition, we'd love to hear both your existing feedback and ideas about what like to see in the extension. Feel free to [get in touch directly](mailto:kevin.bluer@consensys.net) or via one of our [community channels](https://trufflesuite.com/community/).

Last but not least, a huge thanks to the team at Microsoft that worked on the extension. We're excited to be building on all the amazing work that's gone into it thus far!
