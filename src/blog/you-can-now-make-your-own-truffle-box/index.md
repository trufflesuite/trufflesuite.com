Two months ago we unveiled official integration with **Truffle Boxes**, example Ethereum applications and/or boilerplates that put complimentary tools and libraries into sweet, easily-downloadable packages. In addition to rolling out some official boxes, [Status.im](https://status.im/) released [the first community-supported box](/boxes/status).

Today we're happy to announce anyone can now make their very own Truffle Box!

## Making a Box

To get started making a box, we've added a page to [our documentation](/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box). For those starting a new box from scratch, we've also created a [blueprint Truffle Box](/boxes/blueprint) to get you started quickly.

## The First Wave

We included a call for pre-screening in the community section of our first box rollout and some trailblazers answered the call!

Here are the first community boxes:

**[Quintor/angular-truffle-box](/boxes/angular-truffle-box)**<br/>
This Truffle Box provides a base for working with the Truffle Suite and Angular. It provides a basic working example of the MetaCoin contracts with Angular components. This project is generated with Angular CLI.

**[hackingbeauty/react-dapp-material-ui](/boxes/react-dapp-material-ui)**<br/>
In addition to Webpack and React, this box adds: React-Router, Redux and Material-UI for easy skinning of a Dapp.

**[antony/svelte-box](/boxes/svelte-box)**<br/>
A Truffle box using SvelteJS and Rollup. This box contains everything you need to start building a smart-contract app.

**[kierenh/vue-dark-chocolate](/boxes/vue-dark-chocolate)**<br/>
A truffle box that comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts from a Vue App with Bootstrap styling and components. Supporting frameworks include Vuex, Vue-Router & Bootstrap 4 (via Bootstrap-Vue) and webpack. The sample uses webpack-dev-server for hot-reloading or you can build and serve from express.

Check out [the full list of boxes here](/boxes).

A huge thank you to our entire community! We're humbled by your dedication and excited to see what's in store for the future.
