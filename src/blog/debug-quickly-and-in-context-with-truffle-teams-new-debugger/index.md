If you've used Truffle's debugger, you know it's best-in-class. Until now though, it's been confined to the command line. Today the debugger breaks out of the console to a GUI within Truffle Teams! This is a huge workflow enhancement--allowing us to debug transactions in the places we're already viewing--via the deployment details screen or while monitoring individual contracts. Let's take a look!

<p class="alert alert-info">
  <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> <strong>Note</strong>: To use the debugger right away, you'll need to opt-in to <a href="/blog/try-new-features-first-with-truffle-teams-early-access">Truffle Teams Early Access</a>.

## Launching the Debugger

To launch the debugger, we just need to find a transaction. Head over to the Deployments screen and select a deployment. From there select the transactions tab or click the monitoring button for a contract. You'll notice there's a debug button on each transaction card; clicking it will open the Truffle Teams debugger.

## Navigating the UI

Starting at the top, you'll see the transaction hash along with an icon noting its status and, if applicable, the accompanying error message (1). Below that we have our functions, from left to right: Step Next, Step Over, Step In, Step Out, and Reset (2). Next we have some tabs showing the contracts included in this transaction (3). Finally we have two panes, one showing our Solidity with the current step highlighted in yellow (4). The second with our variables (5).
