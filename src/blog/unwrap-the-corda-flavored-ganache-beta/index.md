Earlier this year at TruffleCon [we announced our partnership with Corda to develop a Corda Flavored Ganache](https://youtu.be/MtOaXVt1yOE?t=697). Then, at CordaCon in London [we shared more details around the integration](https://www.r3.com/videos/truffle-and-corda/).

**Today, we are proud to share with you [the beta release is live](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta.1)!**

As a quick refresher: Ganache is Truffle's "one click blockchain" that allows you to run a test network for local development. You don't need an internet connection and because it's all on the same machine, Ganache allows users to see the status of the network in greater detail than on a live network.

We're thrilled to release Ganache for the Corda Blockchain, as this lowers the barrier of entry for Corda developers by allowing them to easily set up a local network on their machines, giving introspection into the state of that network across various nodes and visibility to transactions normally hidden by a live Corda network's privacy protections.

With the Beta version, Corda Flavored Ganache brings you:

* **One-click** Corda network configuration and initialization, so you can focus on what matters most: your application.
* **Easy access** to all your application's data, including network map, notaries, nodes, transactions, and states.
* **Multiple workspaces** for all of your Corda projects; workspaces contain configurations of a Corda network map, notaries, nodes, transactions, accounts, and ledgers.

As always, Truffle's tools come standard on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

We are excited to share this with the Corda community and **we also need to your help!** Since this is a Beta release, we know it's not perfect. If you find a bug, do us a favor and file an issue [here](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/issues/new).
