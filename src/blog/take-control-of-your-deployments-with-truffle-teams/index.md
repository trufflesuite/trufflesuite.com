If you read our [blog post back in July](/blog/an-easier-way-to-deploy-your-smart-contracts), attended my TruffleCon workshop **Push It! Push It Real Good: Truffle Teams Intro & Deployments** back in August, or tuned in last week to our **Truffle Teams Overview** webinar, you've known something awesome has been in the works for Truffle Teams.

Well it's finally here! On behalf of the whole team, I'm excited to announce Deployments within Truffle Teams!

## Bridging the Gap Between Local Ganache Testing and Public Testnet/Mainnet Deployments

The interaction between Truffle and Ganache provides an awesome way to iteratively test and fix contracts on a personal Ethereum blockchain. However, it can be a little tricky when you're ready to publish your application to the rest of the world. That's where Truffle Teams Deployments comes in: we give you a **dead-simple deployment experience** which links with MetaMask so you never need to export your private keys.

## Benefits of Deploying with Truffle Teams

- **Easily deploy to public Ethereum networks** (Mainnet, Ropsten, GÃ¶rli, Rinkeby, and Kovan are supported)
- **Works with the existing migration scripts** in your Truffle project; Truffle Teams uses `truffle migrate` under the hood
- **No need to export/import private keys** â€” use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to deploy like you would with any other dapp
- **Deploy with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) hardware wallets** within MetaMask
