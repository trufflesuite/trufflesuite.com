title: We've moved our github repo!

---

We recently released [Truffle 3.0](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v3.0.2) in February to [much fanfare](/dashboard). As part of that release we separated our codebase into multiple different modules to make integrating with Truffle easier. Those modules now live in the github repository [https://github.com/trufflesuite](https://github.com/trufflesuite), which hints at our broader mission of providing a comprehensive suite of tools for Ethereum development.

## But something was missing...

We forgot Truffle! The main Truffle repository -- including the Truffle command line tool -- remained at it's old [Consensys](https://github.com/consensys) location while its modules hung out at their new digs. We thought to ourselves: That just wouldn't do. So, as matter of announcement, Truffle has officially moved. It's new home is [https://github.com/trufflesuite](https://github.com/trufflesuite).


## Wait, there's more.

The [Truffle Suite](https://github.com/trufflesuite) repository will soon be filling up with more open-source tools to make your Ethereum development life easier. We're not ready to announce what those are yet, but stay tuned for some awesome announcements in the coming weeks.

## While you're here.

While we're announcing things, we should let you know we have a new Twitter account: [@trufflesuite](https://twitter.com/trufflesuite). Feel free to reach out to use there for all your Truffle needs.

Au revoir for now!
