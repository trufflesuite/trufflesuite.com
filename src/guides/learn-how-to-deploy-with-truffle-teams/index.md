title: Truffle Suite

---

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy your smart contracts to a public Ethereum network using Truffle Teams.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you've already done the following:
- [Created a Truffle Teams account](/docs/teams/getting-started/creating-an-account)
- Linked a repo that is a Truffle project (need a project? Grab our MetaCoin box with `truffle unbox metacoin` in an empty directory, and push that to your own repository)
- Got a passing build within Truffle Teams
- [Grabbed some Ropsten Ether](https://faucet.metamask.io/)
- Ensured you'll have a stable network connection

## The Deployments Page

Head over to [Truffle Teams](https://my.truffleteams.com).

On the left navigation bar, click the item near the top labelled **DEPLOYMENTS** next to the parachute icon.

![Deployments Navbar](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployments-navbar.png)

Here you'll see a list of your repositories. Click on the one you'd like to deploy.

![Repo List](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/repo-list.png)

This will bring you to the deployments page. You'll notice there are three columns: **Commits**, **Staging**, and **Production**.

### Commits Column

**Commits** is a list of all the commits that Truffle Teams is processing, or has processed, as a build. Each will have a status icon to show if the build is in progress, failed, or successful. Commits with a successful icon (a green box with a checkmark, as pictured) will be able to be deployed; the parachute icon in the top right of the commit indicates this.

![Commit Card](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/commit-card.png)

### Staging and Production Columns

**Staging** contains a list of all testnet (i.e. Ropsten, GÃ¶rli, Rinkeby, and Kovan) deployments. **Production** contains a list of Mainnet deployments. We'll expand more on how these work later in the tutorial.

## Your First Deployment

Currently, Truffle Teams supports Ethereum testnets and Mainnet, and we'll be adding support for other targets over time.

In this tutorial, we'll be deploying our application to Ropsten.

Press the parachute icon on the commit you'd like to deploy.

![Parachute Callout](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/parachute-callout.png)

A wizard will pop up; under Destination Network, select Ropsten, and then press **Connect Wallet**.

![Deployment Wizard Ropsten Select](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-wizard-ropsten-select.png)

MetaMask will pop up asking you to login (if you haven't already). Then you will need to press **Connect** to confirm the connection with Truffle Teams.

![MetaMask Connect](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/metamask-connect.png)

If the wizard hasn't changed (i.e. you don't see a button to start deploying), you likely need to switch your MetaMask network to Ropsten. This may reload the page; if this happens, you'll need to repeat the steps above.

![MetaMask Network](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/metamask-network.png)

Before moving on, make sure you have the correct account selected in MetaMask.

![MetaMask Account](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/metamask-account.png)

Now you should see the wizard prompting for a **Deployment Context**. Leave it set to **Create a New Deployment**. We'll cover what this is later in the tutorial. Press the **OK, START DEPLOYING** button!

![Deployment Wizard Ready](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-wizard-ready.png)

From here on, it's important that you don't close the tab, refresh the page, or lose network connection. We're working on a more robust experience that will enable you to pick up unfinished deployments, but for now our current version requires the tab to stay open and connected.

Truffle Teams will only process so many deployments at the same time, so you may see that your deployment has been queued. You'll have to wait (without closing/refreshing the tab) for your deployment to get to the front of the list. However, we're working diligently to make this experience more seamless going forward.

Once your deployment has started processing, you'll see a list of steps Truffle Teams is doing to prepare for your deployment.

![Deployment Wizard Preparing](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-wizard-preparing.png)

Once the preparation steps are complete, you'll see a screen with a list of your migrations being processed. You should also get a pop-up from MetaMask for your first transaction.

![First Transaction](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/first-transaction.png)

You'll notice that this interface with MetaMask is like sending a transaction to any other dapp. It's your account that is sending this transaction, and you have complete control of it. Additionally, we highly recommend that you change the **GAS FEE** to be higher so that your transactions run quicker. For testnets like Ropsten, it's affordable to always select the **Fast** option.

![MetaMask Gas](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/metamask-gas.png)

Once you're happy with the transaction gas fee, press the **Confirm** button to send your transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed (the timing of confirmations from MetaMask and Truffle Teams may be slightly offset), you'll receive the next transaction. Repeat this process until you see a message that your deployment is being finalized.

After a short wait, you'll see a window with your deployment results:

![Deployment Results](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-results.png)

Your contracts are deployed! That was easy. Go ahead and push the **Great! Go Back to Workflow** button or the **X** in the wizard. You'll now see a new card in the **Staging** column with the results of your deployment:

![Deployment Card](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-card.png)

You can click on the **+ Contracts** bar on the bottom of the card to see a list of your deployed contracts and their addresses:

![Deployment Card Instance Details](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-card-instance-details.png)

You can also click the vertical 3 dots in the top right of the card to find a menu. In this menu, you can download a **.zip** file of the Truffle **.json** artifacts used in your frontend webapp, graduate a deployment to production, or archive the deployment. **Note:** Be careful when using the archive feature; we haven't implemented a way to unarchive deployments yet.

## Deployment Context

Circling back to the Deployment Context feature I brushed over earlier when we were setting up our deployment:

![Deployment Wizard Ready](/img/tutorials/learn-how-to-deploy-with-truffle-teams/deployment-wizard-ready.png)

This setting will usually be used for more advanced Truffle applications that utilize the migration system to iteratively migrate more to the blockchain (rather than starting fresh each deployment).

This option will let you select an existing deployment on the same network that you'd like to use the deployed artifacts for. Truffle supports the concept of migrating your application and will only run the new migration scripts from the last deployment (a.k.a. the deployment context). This becomes useful in a handful of scenarios: maybe you added an extra contract to work with your existing deployment, your Truffle project uses proxy contracts to upgrade your contracts, and more. Technically speaking, selecting the Deployment Context will put the Truffle artifacts from the deployment context you selected in the directory before running `truffle migrate`.

## Graduating Deployments

Happy with a particular deployment in **Staging**? You can select the **Graduate** option from the menu to use the same build as the basis of your deployment into Mainnet. Other than selecting a different network in MetaMask, the steps are the same! After you're done, you'll see a new deployment in the production section.
