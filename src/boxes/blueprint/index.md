# Blueprint Truffle Box

This box comes with everything you need to create your own Truffle Box.

## Getting Started

After adding your libraries and code:

1. Delete `box-img-sm.png` and `box-img-lg.png`.

2. Use `box-img-sm-template.png` and `box-img-lg-template.png` to create your own art.

3. Delete the template images and replace them with your art. Be sure your art's filenames don't have -template in them.

4. Customize the box configuration file (`truffle-box.json`) if necessary.

See [the Truffle Box section of our documentation](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/advanced/creating-a-truffle-box/) for more info.
