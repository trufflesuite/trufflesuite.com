## Branching Processes

Pull requests should be made against the `develop` branch.

This repo uses short-lived, prefixed branches. For example, a new blog post would live a branch named something like: `content/cool-truffle-news`. This helps multiple teams touch the site if necessary, while mitigating potential collisions. These are the currently used prefixes:

`content`: edits applying to site content.
`feature`: new features for the website, including new data structures (e.g. blog posts or events).
`fix`: fixes an error in existing code.

## Merging Processes

1. As mentioned above, your contribution will be a branch based off of `develop`
1. Once it's ready for review, please create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/compare) to be merged into (aka base branch) `develop`
1. PRs from Truffle employee require at least one review approval; PRs from external contributors are recommended (though not required) to have >1 review
1. PRs that pass all automatic checks **and** meet the approval criteria above may be merged by anyone (though give the author time to merge it themselves, as they deserve the satisfaction of pushing the button)
    - After a PR has been merged, **please delete the original branch**
1. When preparing to publish to master, anyone may merge `develop` into `master` under two circumstances:
    - **After** successfully testing in the staging environment **or**
    - You get a single Truffle employee approval in a PR to merge from `develop` into `master`

## Build Process & Directory Structure

You can find the HTML and markdown source files inside the `src/` directory.

Files in the `src/` directory move through the build pipeline defined in `metalsmith.js` via a series of middleware-like plugins. Each plugin receives the files in a processed state from the previous one. For example, after using the markdown plugin subsequent plugins will only see the rendered HTML files.

## Layouts, Partials and Helpers

The site uses [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. The page layouts, partials and helper functions can be found in their respective directories: `layouts/`, `partials/`, and `helpers/`.

### Layouts

Layouts are used to define the fonts, scripts and stylesheets unique to a particular page or set of pages, e.g. blog posts or truffle box detail pages. Layouts for items in a collection are prefaced with `single-`, for example: `single-tutorial.hbs`.

All layouts have a special `{{{ contents }}}` variable which renders the page content. The title and desired layout are specified in a yaml block at the top of the document. For example:

```
---
title: Page Title
layout: layout.hbs
---
```

Single blog posts, tutorials, and careers are part of collections that do not need to specify a title or layout; they are provided by the collection.

### Partials

Partials are snippets of HTML used repeatedly throughout the site, such as the navigation bar, or to encapsulate parts of a page, such as the interactive header image on the home screen (`partials/home/suite-header.hbs`).

Partials can also contain child content and take arguments, for example the `breakout` partial for full-container-width, centered breakouts in markdown content:

```hbs
{{#> breakout}}
  ![The Completed Pet Shop Dapp](/img/blog/learn-ethereum-the-fun-way-with-our-pet-shop-tutorial/pet-shop-preview.jpeg "The completed dapp.")
{{/breakout}}
```

### Helpers

Helpers are utility functions for use in [layouts](#layouts) and [partials](#partials). Arguments are separated by spaces.

**NOTE**: You'll see references to the `path` variable throughout our layouts and helpers. This is an object provided via the [`metalsmith-paths` plugin](https://github.com/ahmadnassri/metalsmith-paths).

Some useful helpers include:
* `concat`: Concatenates two given strings. EX: `{{concat "string 1 and " "string2"}}`
* `getPageUrl`: Returns the current page url given a path object. EX: `{{getPageUrl path}}`
* `getMetadata`: Returns a piece of metadata given a collection name, filename, and key. For a list of possible JSON collections to reference, see the top `//Data` section of `metalsmith.js`. EX: `{{getMetadata "blog" path.name "title"}}`
* `makeSlug`: Replaces spaces with dashes in a given string. Special symbols are left intact. EX: `{{makeSlug "Some Name to Slug"}}`

## Styles (Sass)

We use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets and [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) as our base component library.

We try organize our stylesheets to follow these guidelines as best we can:
* `sass/overrides.scss`: Overrides to Bootstrap defaults.
* `sass/globals/*.scss`: Styles applicable to components that could be foudn on any page.
* `sass/pages/*.scss`: Page specific styles.
* `sass/vendor/*.scss`: Stylesheets for external libraries used on the site; e.g. Prism for code highlighting.

## Static Files

Static files, such as images or documents, are in the `src/img` folder and the `src/files` folder respectively. They pass through the Metalsmith build pipeline untouched.

## Search

We use [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) for a fully static search engine in our documentation.

To build the search index, we use a custom plugin found in the `metalsmith-moonsearch` directory. At build time, this plugin builds the index using documentation page titles and text content, then embeds it in the page for consumption by Lunr.

## Translating

We welcome translations as well. If you are interested in translating Truffle documentation to a different language:

1. Copy the content you wish to translate (feel free to fork the repository).

1. Host the translated documentation (you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or any hosting solution).

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/issues) pointing to your hosted translations.

We will then investigate and link to your documentation. Thank you!
