## Translating

We welcome translations as well. If you are interested in translating Truffle documentation to a different language:

1. Copy the content you wish to translate (feel free to fork the repository).

1. Host the translated documentation (you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or any hosting solution).

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/issues) pointing to your hosted translations.

We will then investigate and link to your documentation. Thank you!
